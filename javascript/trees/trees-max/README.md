# Challenge Summary

Get the maximum value in the tree

## Whiteboard Process

![White board](./assets/Trees-Largest-Value.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency

The space complexity O(n) while the time complexity is O(n \* log(n))

## Solution

The approach was to use one of the predefined tree traversing methods as they already return all the values as an array. We loop through the array to return the largest value
